# `import-xml` removes the database and builds a new one from the start,
# it shouldn't be used because we are waiting for a well structured new database

# Extra arguments will be passed to subcommand `build-test-db` of `manage-db`, use `manage-db build-test-db -h` to see
# detailed help
# It takes about half a minute with -m 2
