# .dockerignore affects COPY and ADD command in Dockerfile and ignores specified files while building the docker image

# should you have private files in your local working tree (e.g. backup files, caches, logs),
# it should be added to your .dockerignore when you build and publish image to avoid irrelavant files to be added
# to the official image

# This file is an example.
# You should copy paste this file and rename it to .dockerignore when you want to publish an image

# these are the files you always want to exclude
__pycache__
CreeDictionary/django_logs/django.log
CreeDictionary/DatabaseManager/logs/
CreeDictionary/test_db.sqlite3
CreeDictionary/tests/

# other local files in development (if you do have them, these 3 are for an example)
CreeDictionary/db.sqlite3
CreeDictionary/db.sqlite3.bak
CreeDictionary/test_db.sqlite3.bak
# PS. dot files and directories are automatically ignored, so files like .env is not neccesary
